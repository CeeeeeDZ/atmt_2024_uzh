as he had no way of making fire , he ate the fish raw .

he is not a doctor but a teacher .
every great city deserves a great flag .
when was the last time you talked to Tom ?
you are partially responsible .

the responsibility is mine .
we leave for Australia on Monday .
do you remember the day this picture was taken ?
I &apos;m playing with my friends .
I don &apos;t feel like going out .
she wants to meet him again .
one third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth because they didn &apos;t get this change , because they kept treating their people like serfs instead of like shareholders of a common project .

&quot; drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on . &quot;
so - and we haven &apos;t even worked out the cooling needs .
I don &apos;t like your smile .
she liked everything about him .
as layer upon layer of sediment accumulated , pressure from all sides weighed in like a stony glove whose firm and enduring grip held each bone in a stabilizing embrace .
I had nothing to do with that .
you look contented .
even bacteria and some viruses have DNA too .
I know you like to travel .
always that erotic murmur , I &apos;m hardly myself if I &apos;m not in a state of incipient desire .
I don &apos;t want the horse .
and so for many years , I feared that my father would die before I had a chance to kill him .
I asked my teacher what I should do next .
the universe &quot; &quot; is written in the mathematical language . &quot; &quot;
he comes to meet me sometimes .
thanks to you , I spent all my money .
nothing ever makes him angry .
you make my day so much brighter .
Tom tiptoed into the bedroom to avoid waking up his wife .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
we can &apos;t do this again .
don &apos;t you think I know my own husband ?
I just met the most beautiful woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
his room was small but clean , and the food was good .
there is no telling exactly when the earth was born .
now , you &apos;ve heard about &quot; &quot; two degrees &quot; &quot; : that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees .
is it still far ?
now let me show you some of our latest results .
at all events we have done our best .
so in order to build that and make it work , I &apos;m only going to name these things , I &apos;ll not go into them , we need a plan , which is we &apos;re going to build this as an infrastructure for everybody to use , to solve all of these problems .
I only speak a smattering of Japanese .
( Laughter ) Euler discovered at the time the world &apos;s biggest prime : ( 2 ^ 31 ) - 1 .
we got behind the car and pushed .

( Laughter ) That hurts me just to look at .
they said and object like Jupiter would make a drop like this in the star &apos;s light , but they were also saying it was giant .

the old system works .
yes , that &apos;s good .
everyone is friendly to her .
I &apos;m going out .
because we can imagine , in essence , continuing on .

the man was no better than a horse .
Tom is too young to go to school .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t put it into words .
( Applause )

for this reason , farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance .
we &apos;d like another bottle of wine .
and what the penguins show us - and these are all the little dots from where the penguins &apos; positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 - and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests .
I still can &apos;t understand that .
counting sheep helps you to fall sleep .
I would also like to get into the WhatsApp Group .
I never wanted this .
and so a few hours later , Jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house , he sat down at the unplayable piano and began .
what is the use of philosophy ?
he doesn &apos;t know how to write a letter in English .
no one is bound to the impossible , except me !
he has a pithy remark for every occasion .
in the last few years , they &apos;ve grown one cubic foot on average , the standard size of a refrigerator .
and on my last day there , a girl came up to me and said , &quot; I remember the first time I met you . &quot;
I prefer red wine to white wine .
I don &apos;t like people calling me stupid .
I &apos;m certain that won &apos;t happen today .
he is very angry .
yeah .
he &apos;s henpecked .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .

she had a near @-@ death experience .
we worked with the community , not telling them what was going to happen in a language they didn &apos;t understand .
Tom wanted Mary to meet his friends .
the second lesson is very simple .
let me just finish this sentence .
Julie received a Christmas card from her brother in Italy .
do you find that washing machine easy to use ?
Tom isn &apos;t dead .
and she walks away , and I &apos;m flattened .
today is Tom &apos;s birthday .
I can &apos;t decide what to order .
you &apos;re pretty good .
she missed him a lot .
instead , I &apos;d step into my train .
Sami &apos;s plane hasn &apos;t even taken off .

I looked , but I didn &apos;t see anything .
we &apos;re winning .

and without leaving their farms , they take a drop of that genetic material and put it into a little analyzer smaller than a shoebox , program it to detect DNA or RNA from the swine flu virus , and within one hour get back the results , visualize the results .
in my laboratory , we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious bacterial disease in Asia and Africa .
and that mutation was passed on to their kids because they &apos;re the ones that survived , so there was a great deal of population pressure .
my wife is six months pregnant with our first son .
so again , you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city .
he painted a dog .
I like hanging out here .
it &apos;s a complete sham .
and one of the things about the search for massive primes that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search .
he gave in his project late .
come back tomorrow .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I asked you first .
it takes control of these cells , turns them into virus @-@ making factories , and they all burst , a huge , extended bacteria family , all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts , the viruses taking over the bacterium .
I &apos;ve already filled out the form .
he lived to be seventy years old .
my dog has cancer .
that &apos;s what we see in the brains of Alzheimer &apos;s patients .
maybe you &apos;re right , after all .
there &apos;s a gigantic gear representing industry , there &apos;s a ship recognizing the port , a giant stalk of wheat paying homage to the brewing industry .
and there are a lot of other pressures .
why are you even here ?
the BBC is my favourite channel .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening .
there are four seasons in a year - spring , summer , fall , and winter .
and so the sense that I had was there was a giant gap here .
time will always take revenge on those who forget about it .
my concern is the future .

Tom &apos;s dog has four legs .
every one of us can actually test DNA ourselves .
I thought you &apos;d want to meet my family .
I &apos;m not certain .

it &apos;s an outrageous imposition on my 4th Amendment right to privacy , and you &apos;re going to be sued for all the money you &apos;ve got . &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve got nothing to say .
the nice thing is , if you look down here in Argentina , there &apos;s no surface oil pollution from this composite map .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like the same kind of music .
have you had any work done ? &quot;
he is just musically gifted . he mastered the guitar in one year at the age of 15 .
but now we &apos;ve got together a diverse group of people - medics , biologists , geneticists , chemists , physicists , engineers and mathematicians .
the baby started to cry .
Dragons spit fire .
I like the way you treat me .
I found it .
do your best and don &apos;t worry .
so this one ...
I can touch the ceiling .
one hundred fifty @-@ two million phones were thrown out in the U.S. last year ; only 11 percent were recycled .

Tom showed Mary the ropes .
oranges are sweeter than lemons .
I hung out with my friends at the mall .

a talkative person is always letting the cat out of the bag and jeopardizing the interests of others .
that is the essence of being human .
we &apos;re going to make a utility , the utility has to be universal , you can use it everywhere , I &apos;m just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along .
please give me a cup of water .
few people , if any , could survive a nuclear war .
this is what &apos;s been powering the U.S. economy .
it took him , by his estimate , &quot; three years of Sundays . &quot;
what have you done today ?
I want the truth from you .
so together , we convinced a colleague of ours who works on SETI , the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence , that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue .
let &apos;s go back to the year 2000 .
I &apos;m a woman , in case you &apos;re wondering .
that couple was made for each other .
I don &apos;t want to live here by myself .
the guards call them &quot; &quot; balancers , &quot; &quot; meaning they help balance out the racial numbers , in hopes of deflecting law suits .
if Tom and Mary are going to the zoo with you , I &apos;ll go , too .
like a leaf in the autumn breeze .
Jarrett was avoiding those upper registers , he was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard , which gave the piece a soothing , ambient quality .
of course , I think any of us , in any remotely similar situation , would feel the same way , we &apos;d have the same instinct .
he is her only child .
so I like to call that intuitive framework our environmental folklore .
you are being watched . &quot; &quot;
how &apos;s your old lady doing ?
I thought my head was going to explode .
the jingling of my tags drove me mad .
we &apos;re in the business of connecting with consumers . &quot; &quot;
do you have anything to say to us ?
they take primary data from CT scans and MRIs , translate it into digital information , animate it , put it together into the components of the child itself , surface @-@ scan elements of the child that have been casted as needed , depending on the surgery itself , and then take this digital data and be able to output it on state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , three @-@ dimensional printing devices that allow us to print the components exactly to the micron detail of what the child &apos;s anatomy will look like .
she called him every other day .
Tom knew this was going to happen .
I &apos;m in love .
and standing there , alone in the desert , it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is vanishingly small .
how awful !
almost everything has been improved .
and today , of course , you all know that the most productive nation on earth is Luxembourg , producing about one third more wealth per person per year than America .
( Laughter ) But PISA has shown what &apos;s possible in education .

I &apos;m incredibly tired .
sea monsters like the mosasaur were real .
we can rely on Tom .
I had a good teacher .
they like to dance .
she married a local boy .
do you like horror movies ?
I want to get into a party , I hold up the psychic paper , I show you a party invitation .
Tom is throwing stones at birds .
so when I went to study the Magellanic penguins , I didn &apos;t have any problems .
a lot of change .
they started all at once .
he denied having said such a thing .
what exactly are you proposing ?
which proves that psychic paper has an MSE interface .
I know you &apos;ve got a gun .
beans and peanuts are pulses ; many wildflowers , forbs .
you go to the next country on the list , Luxembourg , and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea , so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does .
the price is reasonable .
I had to get back home .
miss Sato is the president &apos;s new secretary .
and the reason why they &apos;re ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries , and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core .
down came the rain in torrents .
a lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage .
these seeds are not being sold .
this job gives me the hump .
I don &apos;t even know how old Tom is .
of course not , otherwise I wouldn &apos;t be here talking to you .
you can &apos;t smoke in here .
naturally , in these circumstances , I turn to Doctor Who .
they &apos;re cooking now .
why is she so popular ?
and if you think about it , it &apos;s even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first .
how far away do you think that ship is ?
where did you hide the food ?
it turns out what you &apos;re thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see .
tell me why you were absent from school yesterday .
and I said , just arrange these , from what &apos;s important to you and what &apos;s not , and then tell me why .
I am a Hazara , and the homeland of my people is Afghanistan .
promise me you won &apos;t do that again .
so , Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year : &quot; &quot; the prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO2 release . &quot; &quot;

I had a good sleep last night .
no doubt .
she was arrested and accused of being a spy .
I called him to the telephone .
don &apos;t do anything by halves .
she worked hard .
whatever you do , don &apos;t push that button .
wherever he is , we shall find him .
so the oceans don &apos;t always act together ; they act differently , but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with , and it &apos;s not easy .
the teacher told me that Hitler killed himself .
who are you texting ?
but I think what &apos;s really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job , but how they felt about it .
and that brought back to me the stable I worked on weekends when I was 12 , and a splendid piebald stallion , who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that , though more hugely of course , enormous , gleaming , resplendent .
please feel free to make suggestions .

how many colours are there ?
my monkey ran away !
it &apos;s his stag do .
never will I see her again .
zero is a special number .

you can fool all the people some of the time , and some of the people all the time , but you cannot fool all the people all the time .
brown is not her natural hair color .
I know no one in this city .
the means of communication can include letters , magazine and newspaper advertisements , radio and television commercials , and telephone marketing , as well as catalogs .

speaking English isn &apos;t easy , but interesting .
my plan is still better than yours .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
I wanted to speak to you about this .
MySQL loads several tables .
and so I think that we evolved ...
my god is the greatest !
he provided us dust monitors .
very disappointing results .
please change the punctuation .
but even Luxembourg can spend its money only once , and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well .
they sign me in .
and we &apos;re just beginning to understand this stuff .
let &apos;s go back to this case now .
I &apos;d really rather be alone right now .
scientists are meant to publish results , and this situation was far from that .
I &apos;m glad you invited me to your party .

his legs are long .
he &apos;s dating my daughter .
it &apos;s very difficult to improve the function of all those parts of the house .
he was subjected to torture by the police .

I can &apos;t do it alone . you have to help me .
so with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on , I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something .
I said nothing about the matter .
he is very afraid of dogs .
do you have enough blankets ?
I &apos;m just going to talk about two things .
Tom drinks at least three liters of water every day .
Sami was laughing about that .
although Mary is sick , she will work .
we went on the deck and turned our torches on and off to attract the attention of any passing boat .
but there &apos;s still potential for discovery of big and exciting things .
PH : so , to wrap up , I &apos;d love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan , who , 40 years ago , was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change , and I think that , today , traditional Hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before .
we must try to protect the environment .

Tom is easygoing , isn &apos;t he ?
are you going to tell him ?
and to help with that , I &apos;m going to add a fourth part to our formula , which is this : get as far away from other paleontologists as possible .
he has plans .

I want to get back .
so that was what needed to be challenged .
it &apos;s true that it would be easier for students if there were only one single Spanish dialect , but that &apos;s quite far from being the case .
Tom has a terrible memory .
and that &apos;s how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century , right ?
you must do it at once .
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a decent car .
no one here will betray you .

you will give me this letter .
so what did we find ?

I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not quite as difficult to do as it sounds .
am I the only one ?
he is not my cousin .
will they elect him for four more years ?
Tom told me that he &apos;d be late .
no , I don &apos;t remember . I wasn &apos;t born yet .
I love the way Tom does that .

I can &apos;t imagine my life without Tom .
were you excited ?
they can &apos;t do it naturally , so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon , take some cells out of an adult gaur &apos;s mouth , code , take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow &apos;s egg , reprogram cow &apos;s egg - different gene code .
I started taking a look as well at different perimeters , because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data .

I might as well die as lead such a life .
now this little critter , it &apos;s only about half a millimeter in size , not terribly charismatic .

&#91; it &#93; is that we are powerful beyond measure .
Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear .
I didn &apos;t want you to get involved .

STM 5 : I &apos;m taking my gloves , 8 to 8.1 / 2 , all right ?
he hides his head in the sand , like an ostrich .
you need to eat something before you go to work .
Mennad knows .
she &apos;s two years younger than him .
his car is gaining on us .
now shake hands and make up .
money opens all doors .
it wasn &apos;t all that funny .
there are people here who need your help .
there was black liberation .
in my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful , many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted .
not bad for a beginner .
first , let me introduce my husband , Raoul .
all major credit cards are accepted .
why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
no one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
I had to work overtime yesterday .
please wait a moment .
we remember .
and I &apos;m making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students .
Reagan became President of the United States in 1981 .

we &apos;d like separate checks .
how can you concentrate ?
she didn &apos;t exactly agree with me .
I gave the boy what little money I had .
let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed .
we caught him red @-@ handed .
Collaborator Three : for all of the frames to be drawn by fans , each individual frame , it &apos;s got a very powerful feeling to it .
it &apos;s a typo . sorry .
so the default position is just : believe all patterns are real - All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind .
you &apos;ve got your permit , right ?
because think about how you consume architecture .
help me , please .
prices are high .
take mine .
so as we get closer to the &apos; 80s , we start to reengage those symbols .
how did I look ?
it has been fine for a week .

is Tom a witness ?
he still crashes the country because he doesn &apos;t understand how the rules have changed .
why wouldn &apos;t you let me tell you what happened ?
right now , about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea , right ?
that &apos;s how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of Chicago .
get rich !
Nancy has a piano .
bread is half price today .
why aren &apos;t you answering me ?
Peter was an altruistic video game player ; he would give items to people who needed them , rather than selling them for personal profit .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
I had some things to do .
we are eight altogether .
first of all , as I explained , to ask a computer &quot; &quot; Is that number prime ? &quot; &quot; to type it in its abbreviated form , and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy , is a remarkably simple question to ask .
( Laughter )
what time does your watch say it is now ?
no , no , no !
I like my steak rare .
I think I shouldn &apos;t have married you .
anybody see an object there ?
when I entered the kitchen , she was making chicken curry with rice .
there are lots and lots of different variables , the operating temperature , the materials , all the different dimensions , the shape .
how much did they give you for your old car ?
and on coral reefs , where some of the main framework organisms disappear , we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .
( Applause ) Thank you .
when we look at other places in the universe , it could very well be that photosynthetic life is the exception .
some kinds of food make one thirsty .
in the 1950s , this virus nearly wiped out the entire production of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii .
I &apos;m still not sure .
the soul is immortal .
I &apos;m studying art at school .
how did that whole thing happen ?
being &quot; master &quot; he felt the weight of honour and the chain of slavery . he preferred lots of privacy .
I know you considered me a close friend .
Wax the floor .
and from that , we actually calculate that we know about 16,500 marine species and there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go .
he wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
here &apos;s a picture that I took in Southern Patagonia .
the freight train was held up about half an hour because of a dense fog .
teaching is learning .
in this example here , we had monitored this reef in Galapagos with temperature recorders , so we know the temperature of the water the coral &apos;s growing in .
it wasn &apos;t until the 1990s that scientists finally uncovered the genetic basis of resistance .
you aren &apos;t in a hurry , are you ?
but I do have an idea , and that idea is called Housing for Health .
SK : I believe Milwaukee is a great city .
the boys played in the mud .
we need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease and that if we try , we can beat it .
there is nothing like cold beer on a hot day .
it is now that it becomes interesting .
I can &apos;t stand it anymore .
you get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen .
can you beat that ?
so four issues .
we managed to swim across the river .
they admired the lovely scenery .
excuse me , do you know what time it is ?
you &apos;d be fed a simple audio clip .
I explained it to all my friends .
we all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next .
we &apos;re not done .
I &apos;ll keep your advice in mind .
&quot; can I write Kabyle at Tatoeba ? &quot; &quot; what I say belongs to the olive tree . the words are no longer mine . &quot;
my computer crashed and now it won &apos;t start up .
dare I admit that after she did it I never really loved her again ?
I &apos;m aware of the danger .
please get this work finished by Monday .
I struggled to get out of the subway .
I was afraid I &apos;d be late .
RM : the design of the Chicago flag has complete buy @-@ in with an entire cross @-@ section of the city .
that &apos;s called a babygram , a full X @-@ ray of a child &apos;s body , a little infant &apos;s body .
I want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
we walked more quickly than usual .
I want you to have this .
I was ready today .
don &apos;t leave the front door open .
we mistook him for an American .
and tourism campaigns can just be cheesy .
the contract is in the bag , so let &apos;s go out and celebrate .
we just believe .
identity is , especially when you &apos;re a teenager , a fluid thing .
artificial intelligence can now collect information from social media and the internet to help designers understand what the public likes .
please , tell me .
it &apos;s about concrete .
I &apos;m not tired right now .
we actually don &apos;t know .
well , good morning .
journalist : yes , of course .
she danced all night long .
second , the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick .
I forgot my bag .
I opened a bottle of red wine .
that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning , intention and agency , often invisible beings from the top down .
some of the records show lower temperatures than others .
but if a textbook seems too much fun , it &apos;s somehow unscientific .
of course , I knew it was dangerous .
thank you .
they were complacent .
it turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago , white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way .
the prisoner escaped under cover of night .
Sami used to wear glasses all the time .
can I eat that ?
give me a ring if you find out anything .
he felt it was his duty to go .
which book do you need ?
I mean , think about it : the care we take in selecting sunglasses , or jewelry , or accessories is really important , so if it isn &apos;t beautiful , it really doesn &apos;t belong on your face .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t resist .
all took part in the negotiations .
I admit that at first I didn &apos;t like you .
I &apos;m busy getting ready for tomorrow .
and it means that a building doesn &apos;t have to be beautiful to be lovable , like this ugly little building in Spain , where the architects dug a hole , packed it with hay , and then poured concrete around it , and when the concrete dried , they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that &apos;s left when it &apos;s done is this hideous little room that &apos;s filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made , and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset .
if Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
okay , now I &apos;m going to ask you to pucker up .
long , long ago , there lived an old man in a village .
have you ever shaken with cold ?
he &apos;s allergic to cats .
and there &apos;s also up and down trends within some of these dips , almost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other .
it &apos;s used a lot in marketing , and it &apos;s used a lot , I think , in our conversation when we &apos;re talking about sustainability , and that &apos;s the word biodegradability .
I can &apos;t believe it either .
my house faces the sea .
why are you looking at me like that ?
I was not aware of any epidemic problems in America .
Sami drowned in the swimming pool .
Oh ! marvelous !
I don &apos;t know how else to say it .
and so what they found , in fact , is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans .
you seem to have a crush on Tom .
Tom is hiding in the attic .
do you have much snow in your country ?
you aren &apos;t invited .
&quot; &quot; as young as I look , I am growing older faster than he .
we &apos;re gonna have a lot of fun .
this is one of the plights of penguins : oil pollution .
and so when the science team looked at it , we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , there &apos;s probably just something wrong with the data . &quot; &quot;
sixty @-@ five percent of Brits admit to over @-@ filling their kettle when they only need one cup of tea .
so we drill back in time to see how often that &apos;s happened , and exactly how fast that ice can melt .
there &apos;s no organic method .
keep in mind that smoking is not good for your health .
so that ice sheet is partly floating , and it &apos;s exposed to the ocean , to the ocean heat .
it &apos;ll only show you the party invitation if I actually have one .
I &apos;d like Tom to be happy .
but forget her breasts .
are they satisfied ?
he drinks too much coffee .
Tom abandoned his family .
there are six billion mobile phone subscriptions as of last year .
I hardly ever run into him .
Tom and I study French together .
I hate hospital food .
why do they do that ?
some snakes are poisonous .
Collaborator : I felt really sad when he died .
the plastic surgeon succeeded in reconstructing the hand of a patient after several long and delicate operations .
thanks to his efforts , he attained his object .
I thought he would be upset .
and the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it , who committed the crime .
he &apos;s walking back to feed his chicks .
Tom promises the Scots the moon .
the feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it &apos;s often written in LOLcats , but nonetheless it &apos;s so appreciative , so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science .
can cats really see in the dark ?
and I just wanted to show you what happened one day when Turbo brought in a friend .
my sister is playing with dolls .
we &apos;re sunk .
I don &apos;t have all the facts .
and these are our models who are going to help us , Roger and Matt .
Sami has been married six times .
you live on a small farm in the Philippines .
today , farmers can take those samples themselves .
another example .
girl 2 : that would be so stressful .
does Tom like Mary ?
and then you can see people celebrating the next day .
I turned to my mom and dad to tell them we needed to go home , and at that moment , you came out of the student union building wearing the stupidest hat I &apos;ve ever seen in my life . &quot; &quot;
I am not ashamed of my father &apos;s poverty .
Tom is always playing video games .
the fish is degraded 20 percent , 50 percent and then the one I showed you , 70 percent .
we used it in the 19th century to build art museums .
he is far from happy .
what did you discover ?
what was it that Mary bought yesterday ?
this is strictly forbidden .
that &apos;s a good way to solve a complicated problem .
I sat at the bar .
and it was rigged , and it became unraveled when this man , Charles van Doren , was outed after an unnatural winning streak , ending Berry &apos;s career .
always .
one can have an instant access to the desired information on the Internet .
at the very end of it , I showed a list under that title .
well , first thing we do , we get showers working .
you &apos;re hearing a person &apos;s life .
I &apos;d called this the &quot; &quot; everything &quot; &quot; theory , or EOE : everything On Earth .
but I heard that you were leaving , and I had to come and tell you you &apos;ve been an incredibly important person in my life .
I don &apos;t remember what it was about .
last winter , I went skiing in Canada .
that means we don &apos;t need the Greeks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture .
and we also designed the condoms themselves .
what did she buy at the shop ?
do I know you ?
if you tell Tom what to do , he &apos;ll do it .
it &apos;s not brain surgery .
you &apos;re not bad looking either .
voice 2 : next on the gourmet pet channel , decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer .
I am counting on you to deliver the opening address .
she used to wash her hair before going to school .
I think love does not exist .
they met in high school .
it is the default option .
this series of books comprises forty @-@ eight volumes .
he slammed his door shut .
( Laughter ) And some of them , many of them actually , had water that came into more than one room .
Incorporate . &quot;
we know this because of long @-@ term science , because we have long @-@ term studies there .
could I have the bill , please ?
the coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
a sailor is at sea much of the time .
if it means no special gadgets , it has to run on a mobile phone .
can you tell me what it means ?
I awoke to find a burglar in my room .
I had barely got into the house when the phone rang .
I &apos;m not happy with my looks .
that &apos;s great , perfect for 13 @-@ year @-@ olds .
it &apos;s already 11 .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
it is in the restaurant where Dan eats lunch .
and in the 20th century in America , we used it to build houses .
I love living with you .
I would rather walk than wait for the next bus .
he told me that his father &apos;s a teacher .
is your baby sleeping ?
thank you .
nobody knows .
my starting to fancy she &apos;d ended up in this fire @-@ trap in the Village , that my neighbor was her .
and this was the 1970s , it was Luton , where he worked at Vauxhall Motors , and he was a Jamaican .
and so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins .
I will deal with them myself .
although there &apos;s still the kind of temporariness that our parents felt about being here , but we children knew that the game was up .
I &apos;m sorry if I snapped at you .
she committed a crime .
( Laughter ) I actually asked to visit McGowan in the CMU .
and that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people .
it &apos;s OK with me .
it &apos;s very kind of you to say so .
it &apos;s like one of those .
some years , the cold water goes all the way up to Brazil , and other years , in these La Nina years , it doesn &apos;t .
so in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus , I can &apos;t show you the clip , due to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne @-@ style copyright by the BBC , but in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus , Doctor Who is clearly shown getting on to the bus with the Oyster card reader using his psychic paper .
why are you so interested ?
I won &apos;t always be around to help you .
I think it &apos;s the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism .
he wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology , and those are pillars of his life , but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child .
in fact , neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior , things like paranoia , delusions and hallucinations , these are patternicities .
feel this .
well , I could stand here for hours , but , of course , I &apos;m not allowed to do that .
unlike the Moon - our dead , rocky companion - the Earth is alive , pulsing with creative and destructive forces that power its geological metabolism .
I went to the market .
she &apos;s really rushing back , because it &apos;s hot , to try to feed her chicks .
so , this is what a new map of the world looks like .
what did you do then ?
( Applause ) Thank you .
whatever you do , don &apos;t smile .
now , when a planet transits a star , it blocks out a little bit of this light , and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself .
I already said yes .
you don &apos;t have to be a victim .
by 2007 , the catch was actually laughable in terms of the size for a trophy fish .
we can &apos;t give up .
do you have your pills ?
we didn &apos;t have any hope .
we work with tree rings .
you &apos;d better not wait here .
people are talking .
the kitchen is not a suitable place for arguments . too many knives .
are you productive ?
let me have a minute with her .
he took back what he had said about her .
this man is incompetent .
there is a thick sheet of foggy , bulletproof glass and on the other side was Daniel McGowan .
and then you have TV Guide , a Fox property , which is about to sponsor the online video awards - but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television , not appearing to gloat .
he is our very first starchitect .
but there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that number .
I am very busy .
I can &apos;t ignore that .
but as soon as we go hunting for massive primes , we realize it &apos;s not enough just to put in any prime number in the power .
thank you .
do you feel lucky ?
WP : absolutely .
and I haven &apos;t spoken to you once in the four years since that day .
Tom opened the trunk of the car .
the inventor of this DNA @-@ copying technique was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 .
I do not like music .
my first mall job that I had as a teenager was at a sporting goods store called Herman &apos;s World of Sports .
I &apos;ve never been to a professional baseball game .
she went there yesterday .
time and time again he would say this to us .
are you out of your mind ?
miss Smith is liked by all students .
he cannot be relied on .
the guild leader relegated Vince to a lesser officer because he was abusing his power .
I like to just end .
what &apos;s wrong with those ?
I haven &apos;t seen him lately .
so I log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing .
they had to change their schedule because the train arrived late .
where exactly did you go ?
he works in a bank .
she seems to be interested in him .
how much is this ball ?
I refused to believe it .
the scene was clearly printed in my memory .
I knew you &apos;d come back to me .
I guess my luck just ran out .
only a miracle may get him out of it .
the lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause : a lack of awareness .
those who know do not talk . those who talk do not know .
we can &apos;t solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way .
what kind of tattoo do you want ?
she found him standing near the entrance .
I need to see you in my office .
TK : the blue stripes represent the water , the river and the lake .
it &apos;s 1.3 billion tons of food per annum .
and yet one more tap , and you &apos;d be &quot; &quot; liking &quot; &quot; Auntie Glenda on Facebook .
don &apos;t buy me presents anymore .
so you &apos;ve got to give them your Facebook password .
your room number , please .
in your heads right now , there is cerebrospinal fluid just bathing your brains and making its way around .
down came the rain in torrents .
&quot; this is cheaper than a new hat , &quot; Susan answered .
she poisoned her husband .
our guests have arrived .
her face was soaked with tears .
obviously , we hope that the strike is - that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible .
do you want to come along and give it a go ?
so Keith Jarrett left .
I appreciate your support .
they can &apos;t do that .
I have three times more books than he has .
this is my father , Clinton George &quot; &quot; Bageye &quot; &quot; Grant .
so they have all the criteria that people normally like .
your work has greatly improved .
she owes me money .
where is mom ?
do you work here ?
you don &apos;t sound convinced .
that &apos;s another matter .
this is the future ! &quot; &quot;
Aref and his family fled to New York from Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq as refugees .
I deeply regret having caused the accident .
housing for Health projects aren &apos;t about measuring failure - they &apos;re actually about improving houses .
that &apos;s true for every day except one .
so you can see two countries spent their money very differently , and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education .
WM : today , just for example , I went to get a haircut , and when I sat down in the barber &apos;s chair , there was a Chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in , and then in the mirror , there was a Chicago flag on the wall behind me .
sooner or later , Tom will likely agree to help us .
that fills me with almost sexual excitement .
I &apos;ll get my keys .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
you can keep sitting here with us .
I just don &apos;t want to go with you .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
she looks familiar .
it &apos;s a very small price for such an important victory .
don &apos;t talk to me like this .
the river flows down to the sea .
she &apos;s got food .
in red , sort of below OECD average .
a crowd was gathering around him .
but this particular reality was not inevitable .
since there was no taxi , I had to walk home .
I used to work for an educational publisher , and as a writer , I was always told never to use stories or fun , engaging language , because then my work might not be viewed as &quot; &quot; serious &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; scientific . &quot; &quot;
where exactly do you live ?
are you coming in or not ?
the baby doesn &apos;t walk yet .
your troubles are just beginning .
we want to leave .
she said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I don &apos;t mean that it sucks .
did you forget to do your homework ?
he mistook me for my twin brother .
the two groups share equally in the company .
I wrote it .
not every asylum seeker is lucky like me .
and so every time a new medium arrives , the old medium is the content , and it is highly observable , highly noticeable , but the real , real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium , and it is ignored .
we &apos;ve only been together three months .
they hurried to the scene of the accident .
we &apos;ve actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty , certain kinds of obstacle , can actually improve our performance .
I remember the warmth of his arms .
and we did it 10 times .
take this to your mother .
you don &apos;t need to do that right away .
how would you define &quot; happiness &quot; ?
that she died in the camps made her - I didn &apos;t dare wonder why - more present , more precious .
what time did you get up today ?
I thought it would be a good idea to get back in touch with Japanese culture and history .
who could have expected that it would happen ?
he went back home .
now I have to rewrite my paper . &quot; &quot;
you gotta get more organized .
I &apos;m going to die .
Philip , like Andrew and Peter , was from the town of Bethesda .
I go into the bank at 10 o &apos;clock , go , &quot; &quot; Hi , I &apos;m Dave Birch , I &apos;ve got a 3 o &apos;clock with so and so there . &quot; &quot;
the plant is blue .
I &apos;m sure I don &apos;t need to do that .
why did you let me sleep so late ?
not so in human beings : you cut off an arm , you cut off a leg - it doesn &apos;t regrow .
she doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
they &apos;re not on the real field , but they &apos;re on a simulated field , and they &apos;re playing in the pregame season .
I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing .
you still haven &apos;t told me why you decided not to go .
from the youngest of ages , we display a prodigious sporting talent .
this gift came to me about five months ago .
he advocated State Capitalism over Market Capitalism .
I think it &apos;s a beautiful example of progressive training .
I was too shy .
she always urges him to try new things .
Hi , how do you do ?
you don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
it &apos;s not just my group ; there &apos;s maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this .
Tom began to shiver violently .
she was the valedictorian of her class .
even in the best hands in the world , there is still a challenge to get the volume - the natural volume of these patients - in order to get our expertise curve at 100 percent .
your request has been denied because you have no valid residential address .
and he says , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not about a scientific rendering of a sheep .
you &apos;ll notice here that every hair on the child &apos;s head is reproduced .
let &apos;s plug up the hole .
Peeing sitting down is not all that bad .
we &apos;ve all done things we &apos;re ashamed of .
another item that I find fascinating is the electric tea kettle , which I found out that you don &apos;t do tea kettles in this country , really , do you ?
you liked chocolate .
the bees are disappearing .
Tom lost his glasses somewhere in the garden .
my opinion differs from yours .
the size of the universe is unimaginable .
this is not about money .
you look so pale .
with all his faults , he is respected by everybody .
you &apos;re not allowed in there .
can you tell me where the nearest bus stop is ?
my mom bought me this toy when I was eight years old .
let &apos;s go to the exchange to exchange some dollars for francs .
what will the neighbors think ?
fill out the questionnaire .
( Laughter ) Another thing about primes , there is no final biggest prime number .
he kissed me on the forehead .
it won &apos;t do anything for you .
she was amazed to hear the news .
is there a problem I should know about ?
I can think of several reasons .
and anyone who &apos;s been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep .
so what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do .
and that &apos;s us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom .
these are the trees on the leaves of which silkworms live .
we &apos;re ready now .
I saw him kissing another girl .
I was already married at your age .
and it &apos;s based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people , but really difficult for computers .
get that thing off of me .
and the reason for that is the trouble with the step @-@ by @-@ step process , the marginal gains , is they can walk you gradually down a dead end .
they were using parks they weren &apos;t using before .
know why ?
she treated me badly .
well , they have a host star just like we have a sun , and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star , then that would solve their energy needs .
like hundreds of thousands of other Hazara kids , I was born in exile .
you should not wear a fur coat .
both are so much better .
I know what you want to talk about .
we must think about these plans in terms of what they would cost .
so when you want to draw money out , you put the mobile phone on the ATM , and touch your finger , your fingerprint goes through to the phone , the phone says yes , that &apos;s whoever , and the ATM then gives you some money .
yes , I think you ought to go .
then I am drowning , in despair at having to leave her , this , everything , all , unbearable , awful .
you must not go out at night .
I was only 18 , and I got a job working as an interpreter .
are there survivors ?
things start to get really crazy .
if you think you haven &apos;t , think of all the hands that didn &apos;t go up when I asked .
I saw land in the distance .
his death was a great loss to our firm .
any task may become painful .
does anyone know what this is ?
never tell the truth when a lie will do .
I think Tom is drunk .
it smells delicious .
Tom is a bit strange .
why don &apos;t you come visit us ?
if I had been able to simply fly to Australia , it would have taken me less than 24 hours .
nobody insults my country .
I spent Saturday afternoon watching entirely too much TV .
try to be more punctual from now on .
I &apos;m sorry , I didn &apos;t hear you .
I want to speak to my lawyer now .
you can borrow three books at a time .
I had published leaked CMU documents on my website and the Counterterrorism Unit said that McGowan had called his wife and asked her to mail them .
after the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers , I got a chance to go to Afghanistan for the first time , with foreign journalists .

thank you .
voice 2 : you mean we &apos;ll have to live here , together ?
he often plays stone @-@ paper @-@ scissors .
so we do that , and you &apos;re happy , we feel like sellouts , so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we &apos;ve gone for the last 300 years , and certainly for the last 30 years .
I just wanted to apologize .

and look at these solid , stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements .
my children like school .
how long have you been doing this ?
and the oceans are hugely productive , as you can see by the satellite image of photosynthesis , the production of new life .
she didn &apos;t know that .
do you have a problem ?
it will recalibrate what &apos;s most important in your life .

it &apos;s terrible .
when I got home , I realized that one of my suitcases had disappeared .

birds have sharp vision .
and in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings , and what the program is for those cells to differentiate , one of the things we &apos;re going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells , which you know as cancer , and one of the things we &apos;re going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone , stomach , skin , pancreas .
eventually it was possible to find a really satisfactory solution .
keep an eye on it .
along with my family , I returned back to Quetta .
we &apos;ll decide later .
come on , tell her !
the dog is called Spot by the family .
I could not believe my eyes !
you started crying .
it was lit only by the dim , green glow of the emergency exit sign .
( Applause )

I have something to show you .
it &apos;s a good sign .

I took a few notes last night .
the devil is not so black as he is painted .

I wanted to speak with you first .
Miyazaki is not what it used to be .
you never get a second chance to make a first impression .
this is bad .
you know , some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards .
French is my favorite language .
you see a single roll of grain that &apos;s covered in a hard case .
please show me the way to the station .
and so in this example , a census scientist took out two ships .
I &apos;m not going to force you to do that .
you are not my mother .
imagine that you &apos;re a pig farmer .
I don &apos;t want to talk about this now .
TK : which is a very attractive design element .
she explained to him why she didn &apos;t like his parents .
so it &apos;s how New York communicates with other international cities .
you &apos;ve omitted the preposition in this sentence .
the bomb will explode in 10 seconds .
we have no other choice .
and today , with the help of over 300,000 science enthusiasts , we have found dozens , and we &apos;ve also found one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy .
are you going to save us ?
did you know that it &apos;s actually cheaper now to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones than it is out of a ton of gold ore ?
I &apos;m no different than you .
I &apos;ll finish the work in a week , that is , on May 5th .

may comes after April .
this is what I call a product @-@ person failure .
the fact is that I have no money with me .
every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern , new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues .

I never even considered that .
all languages are equal , but English is more equal than the others .
you really do have a beautiful voice .
we miss you very much .
Ubuntu includes lots of software .
and the really interesting thing is , you and your kids are empowered to build great empires , and you don &apos;t need a lot to do it .
you &apos;re being paranoid .
Tom frowned .
don &apos;t try the patience of God !
that means that by the age of five , you can &apos;t see as well for the rest of your life .
Tom plays the trombone .
it &apos;s absurd of you to do that .
I really like you .
the teacher confiscated a student &apos;s phone because he was texting in class .
and then the U.S. came in about 1950 , and then Switzerland about 1973 , and then the U.S. got back on top - beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks .
why don &apos;t you ride with me ?
I caught a beautiful butterfly .
you &apos;re too suspicious about everything .
my nose is running .
how did you find me ?
you &apos;re not safe here .
Judging from his appearance , he must be a rich man .
he speaks in his sleep .
enjoy yourself to the fullest .
again , it &apos;s being freely distributed .
what &apos;re you doing with my car ?
we know that you &apos;re sick .
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
none of them wanted to talk .
and we started working on it , and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this .
it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible .
and so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preserve what &apos;s left , because there is still spectacular beauty .
to be perfect she lacked just one defect .
she was forced to confess .
why would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook , unless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way ?

Tom hasn &apos;t finished writing the report .
we &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
he was very puzzled .
at that time , my house was under construction .
I &apos;m very fortunate .
you &apos;re such an idiot !
I think that Tom is still sleeping .
they fought the suppliers , they fought the manufacturers .
this book is much more useful than that one .
how did you know that man was a cop ?
so we have this field of science that &apos;s all about slime , and color changes .
when I was a kid , my favorite thing to do was watch movies , and I used to watch movies over and over and over again .
birds fly long distances .
and Hosain Rahman , the CEO of Aliph Jawbone , you know , really understands that you need a different structure .
he hit me twice .

STM 4 : table coming down .
washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs , the common infectious diseases of the eyes , the ears , the chest and the skin that , if they occur in the first five years of life , permanently damage those organs .

I must be leaving now .
behind the phoenix , the background is mostly white , and then it has a substantial gold border around it .
the street in front of my house is pretty narrow .
I &apos;m a single child .

they left the problem unsolved .
Ah yes , those university days , a heady mix of Ph.D @-@ level pure mathematics and world debating championships , or , as I like to say , &quot; &quot; Hello , ladies .
you know what symmetry is , so you don &apos;t need a picture of it .
acid rain is not a natural phenomenon .
who do you live with ?
my bad .
the nerdy side of me thought , &quot; &quot; Wow , this is amazing .
and you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have .
I &apos;ve managed to persuade Tom to come .
last year in Israel , a young ultra @-@ orthodox Rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah forbade them to look in one room .
so some of the suggestions we made as to what we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical , and after a while , someone made a particularly silly suggestion and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism , &quot; &quot; That wouldn &apos;t work .
you &apos;ll have a wonderful time .
Tom likes technology .
I &apos;m going to have to call you right back .

he refused to do much campaigning .
especially when they &apos;re upside down , you &apos;re engaging that general facial recognition software there .
so it &apos;s kind of like you having a job in Chicago , and then you get transferred to St. Louis , and your mate is not happy about this because you &apos;ve got to pay airfare , because you &apos;re gone longer .
Mr Smith teaches me English .
now , I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don &apos;t observe .
I &apos;d like to welcome you all aboard .
who is there ?
Droplets are falling on my laptop computer .
so if you &apos;re a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone &apos;s card , you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to sort of speed things up .
these dips have variable shapes .
Hi , Susan . how are you ?
he thought , &quot; &quot; I know how to drive ; why do I need the state &apos;s validation ? &quot; &quot;
what scares me most about the loud arguments and misinformation about plant genetics is that the poorest people who most need the technology may be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices of those who have enough to eat .
if you &apos;re not careful , you might have an accident .
we can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project , and then we also share in the rewards .

( Applause )
I don &apos;t like your smile .
he went into rehab .
I can &apos;t leave off smoking .
he is heart and soul a Democrat .
our club will hold its monthly meeting next Wednesday .
of course , thanks to the environmentalist movement we &apos;re all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals .
Tom did the best he could , but he still wasn &apos;t able to pass the course .
( Laughter ) I always think in my head , if I owned a dead mall - why don &apos;t they embrace their vintage look ?
if money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes , you would find all the large bubbles at the top , no ?
it is not easy to be understood by everybody .
he asked me point @-@ blank to help him .
both he and I are high school students .
fear causes aggression in dogs .
yes , that was amazing . Unbelievable !
do your job .
I can hold my breath for a long time .
I made her cry .
I was born and raised in Matsuyama .
Tom and Mary raised three children .
Tom shaved off his beard and dyed his hair blonde , hoping people wouldn &apos;t recognize him .
Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I took the little girl by the hand .
Amnesty International claims that Facebook and Google abuse human rights because of overly aggressive collection of user data .
I mean it &apos;s colorful , it &apos;s fun .
may I ask you to do me a favor ?
I have no mind to go for a walk .
thank you for your love .
I &apos;d be disappointed if I saw you doing that .
so barcoding allows us to know what we &apos;re working with and also what we &apos;re eating .
I was frightened of her .
I have always felt that you always knew that Sami was your son .
how much time does the average teenager watch TV every day ?
you ought to have been more careful .
the life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical .
take some for later .
as far as I am concerned , I have no objection .
we have laws , and we can &apos;t have illegal dumping ; it &apos;s against the law . &quot; &quot;
these distractions were actually grists to their creative mill .
it hurts terribly .
I don &apos;t know how to do that .
consider the path .
did you get fired from your last job ?
she has two cats . one is black , and the other is white .
the boss doesn &apos;t know it yet .
he made reference to the previous director .
here &apos;s my team in what &apos;s called the SIM Engineering Division of the Simulator Program .
he &apos;s promising us nothing .
please be polite .
don &apos;t use your real name .
the baby takes after his mother .
I can &apos;t wait to meet him .
but I welcomed that title , and I thought actually , yes , there is a possibility that this will open up conversations that we &apos;d never had before .
( Applause ) And this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself , first 50 or 60 days , then 90 days , and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another 90 days , and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon .
I thought there was a possibility that Tom was going to break the contract .
so , the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible .
the psychologist asked me a whole battery of questions .

they share their same beliefs .
they went to the public swimming pool .
I am lost .
I pleaded not guilty .
I want to avoid rush hour .
a group of young men are playing handball in the playground .

well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains .
how many people can fit in your car ?
I hope the economy picks up soon .
who were you talking to ?
I don &apos;t know anything about marketing .
so this tells us that , in a global economy , it is no longer national improvement that &apos;s the benchmark for success , but the best performing education systems internationally .
the Economist in 2009 said this is &quot; &quot; the approach that will come to prominence . &quot; &quot;
so the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there , otherwise we don &apos;t get where we want to get to .
for this reason , scientists supported by the Rockefeller Foundation genetically engineered a golden rice to produce beta @-@ carotene , which is the precursor of Vitamin A .
only time will tell .
and now look at this : not friendly .
Sydney is far from here .
I made a pot roast .
or you could go out by yourself even to a half @-@ block @-@ long empty lot , into the bushes : like a creature of leaves you &apos;d lurk , crouched , crawling , simplified , savage , alone ; already there was wanting to be simpler , wanting , when they called you , never to go back .
I cannot whistle .
he came to meet me yesterday afternoon .
they hated Tom .
DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini @-@ computer .

epoch after epoch of sameness , nonevents without number .
I had never seen a more beautiful sight .

one out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer &apos;s .
&quot; the economy has opened up a faultline in the Atlantic , &quot; announces La Stampa , reporting on the impact of recent remarks by Barack Obama which imply that the poor management of the Eurozone crisis is to blame for the feeble outlook for growth in the US .
I wonder what all of them have in common .
( Laughter ) Swans grew to the size of buildings .
I thought you might be upset .

I &apos;m so sick of this .
he is always trying to do the impossible .

everyone was screaming .
as he couldn &apos;t endure , he took to his heels .
( Laughter ) She said , &quot; &quot; Everybody lost it .
Tom is not crying .
I have a friend everybody trusts .
Tom declined to comment .
he has been to France .
I had not even time to put on my hat .
I want to give you a couple examples from my own work .
when we do this process , we make two types of errors .
I think it &apos;s one thing to say there &apos;s 140,000 planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time , and it &apos;s another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows .
she told me an interesting story .
how much did you pay for him ?
at least the work is done .
you don &apos;t need to come so early .
you know you &apos;ve hit the big time when you get parodied on The Simpsons .
there &apos;s nothing I can do to dissuade him .
the jury is still out .
a book is always an acceptable gift .
he wiggled his toes .
it &apos;s a hot mess , and Steve Kodis , a graphic designer from Milwaukee , wants to change it .

I should &apos;ve guessed you &apos;d be busy .
we &apos;re not so different , you and I .
we all die .
I don &apos;t know for certain .
I study English at home .

are you a policeman ?
RM : so this San Francisco flag was designed by Frank Chimero based on Ted Kaye &apos;s suggestions .
until when will you be in Japan ?
I wanted to protect you .
we &apos;re going to keep doing this until someone tells us that we can &apos;t .
we &apos;re not killing the colony ; we &apos;re taking a small core sample out of the top .
the problem is , imagine if we actually started to reconsider how we designed things .
it looks like a duck .
and what they found is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean .
watch him at work in this video .

I was in these venues , and people were , you know , really into getting them .
yet , when I started graduate school , no one knew what these genes were .
we &apos;re done .
my husband is in jail .
when I counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census , we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands .
and what &apos;s more exciting is that there &apos;s more data to come .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how the same gene code - that &apos;s why you have 30,000 genes , mice have 30,000 genes , husbands have 30,000 genes .
the lack of evidence to the contrary is itself evidence that your theory is probably right .
as he grew excited , he spoke more and more rapidly .
I have to get to school .
I wish you could have come with me .
Tom looked at the floor .
this is why I hate him .
we thought we needed a marine protected area of about 30 kilometers , and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin .
Tom is presumptuous .
Jean and Jeanne watched the cows .
not only is sex a safe activity but it is also recommended against depression , and contrary to other physical activities , food or even video games , you can &apos;t have too much of it .
how can you be sure of that ?
children are full of energy .
we speak English in class .
is there anything else you want to tell me ?
what &apos;s a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this ?
time was running out for the Earthlings as their planetary environment was in decay . space travel became a necessity .
the red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country &apos;s wealth .
I &apos;m glad I learned English .
Tom may have missed the bus .
I know families who are already living in this reality .
what &apos;s amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren &apos;t looking for something like this .
the attacks on the Hazara community would only get worse , so it was not surprising that many wanted to flee .
he did what I told him to do .
the wound is deep .
it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life .
there are no real visions .
I can &apos;t live without my cat .
you have to go .
everyone suddenly burst into laughter .
for dinner , we went back to my place .
now , unfortunately , that bone was isolated .
I think that he &apos;s probably not a bad boy .
and then you can start going back further , and you can start thinking about dodos , and you can think about other species .
I have lots of money .
I don &apos;t expect you to understand it .
maybe we should just give up .
the magazines were dog @-@ eared .
I &apos;ll bet you can &apos;t guess what happened to me today .
my boyfriend was crying .
too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere .
this is the One Laptop per Child , the $ 100 laptop .
a mother kissed the child .
I called him , but a girl answered the phone .
I &apos;m saving as much as I can .
but we &apos;d also realized in treating other processes and problems that sometimes you don &apos;t need to treat everything .

I have difficulty concentrating .
I thought you did that last week .
I realize that this may sound crazy , but I think I &apos;ve fallen in love with your younger sister .
he took away one and wrote that number on the board .
the door was already open .
and if you look along the coast of Argentina , where I work now , at a place called Punta Tombo - the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude - you see that there &apos;s great variation here .
do you want to tell me what this is ?
I know who didn &apos;t do what they were supposed to do .
and he postulated a suggestion that there &apos;s this infinite , incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe , and as other particles go through those particles and interact , that &apos;s where they get their mass .
I like sleeping .
the girl paused and smiled ; the young man paused and sighed .
I was trapped in a vicious circle .
I want to do my job the best I can .
the comic books were piled on the desk .
stop it right now !
are you ready for Christmas ?
luckily the door was open .
I really loved you .
my hens laid fewer eggs last year .
who gives a fuck ?
I stopped at the store and got some milk on my way back .
the Wildlife Conservation Society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps .

we will implement a reconsidered North @-@ South cooperation mechanism .
we &apos;ve looked everywhere , haven &apos;t we ?
the buds began to burst .
he is away from home .
Sami was working at an insurance company .
we &apos;re learning Spanish .
have you seen him before ?
and there were two treatments in this experiment .
they spent the afternoon around the pool .
run as fast as you can and don &apos;t let go of my hand .
she cannot write or read .
I &apos;ve made up my mind .
the dog was dead .
the girls , to my horror , averted their gaze .
it &apos;s a small library .
he thinks I &apos;m jealous .
that bed is very comfortable .
I &apos;m happy , but he &apos;s tired .
I think we still have plenty of time .
it turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them .
now , how is it possible that these forms - they &apos;re wild and radical - how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world ?
( Applause ) Happy 50th anniversary on your flag , Canada .
I think Tom did a really nice job .
check it out !
he has seen better days .
what did your wife say ?
now , they trade up the politicians every time .
which is brown ?
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer .
( music ) Within moments it became clear that something magical was happening .
they &apos;ve realized they should stop discrimination against gays .
Burma is called &quot; Myanmar &quot; in Burmese .
Oh ! is it true ?
imagine some of the reactions we get : &quot; &quot; really ?
and a month and a half later , I come back to Switzerland , and there he is playing with his own version .
I &apos;m not afraid of your dog .
he wasn &apos;t your brother .
they were not pleased .
HyperCard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks , where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture , or piece of text , or data across a file system , and we had no way of explaining it .
but I &apos;ll tell you some of that today .
and I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley , so I wanted to be there , and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes , that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes .
he has no sense of direction .
copy this program on your computer .
she &apos;s in a state of shock .
I &apos;ve asked that question all across the country , and everywhere I ask it , no matter where , there &apos;s a huge portion of the audience that won &apos;t put up their hand .
his answer was favorable .
children filled the room .
I &apos;ll put you out of your misery .
I can recommend this restaurant .
remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste &apos;s brain a century ago .
brush your teeth properly before going to bed .
you speak good French !
how many cars have you owned so far ?
Tom pointed out my mistake .
I went to bed at twelve last night .
so , we had to design both the light and the light bulb .
and so one of the records that we had was this sooty shearwater , which undergoes these spectacular migrations all the way from New Zealand all the way up to Alaska and back again in search of endless summer as they complete their life cycles .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see you .
I think there &apos;s a better approach .
( Laughter ) Yeah ?
have you finally cleaned your room ?
that lies outside my area of study .
they &apos;re reading a book .
she bought chicken .
he filled the glass with wine .
I saw you with him .
okay ?
would you please show me where the Banque de France is located ?
what are you going to have ?
he excels all his brothers in scholastic ability .
you saw how huge it was , and to give you a sense for this - because we &apos;ve talked a lot about Moore &apos;s law and making things small at this conference , so let &apos;s talk about making things large .
I am leaving Japan tomorrow morning .
he glanced at her and saw she was angry .
there are innumerable stars in the universe .
now , after this particular Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried and de @-@ fleshed by a multitude of bacteria , worms and insects , its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis , exchanging molecules with the groundwater and becoming more and more like the entombing rock .
he will either come or call me .
yes , of course , it &apos;s a cow .
that &apos;s something I like .
you &apos;re faithful .
she comes from California .
excuse me for being late .
Tom walked across the room and opened the window .
now and then your sister asks our sisters to teach her something .
we are one , after all , you and I , together we suffer , together exist and forever will recreate each other .
I &apos;d like a lager .
just act as if nothing has happened .
&quot; &quot; you are being watched .
now , make a thousand more worlds and a thousand more solar systems and let them run .
I used to play tennis with him on Sunday .
they &apos;re just happily living together until a signal happens and - BAM ! - all of the DNA pops out .
Tom washes clothes three times a week .
this is crystallized DNA .
show me everything .
this is a sensitive issue .
it rains softly on the town .
you &apos;re almost right .
why ?
I &apos;ve detected a big mistake .
and the bitter truth really is that , you know , not in many countries .
my daughter won &apos;t listen to me .
that &apos;d be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole . &quot; &quot;
some prominent tennis players behave like spoiled brats .
there &apos;s no shortage of work around here .
seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance - the sort of things that happen in all our houses .
I like being alone .
or , as Nike &apos;s head of marketing says , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not in the business of keeping media companies alive .
do you recognize the man in this photo ?
I &apos;ll talk it over with Marty and see what he thinks .
the photocopier &apos;s hard drive contains copies of everything we printed in the past 12 months .
yeah .
sound familiar ?
they were scolded by the teacher .
we may as well keep it a secret .
it has difficulty growing .
imagine that .
this is really , really useful , because building things is terrifying .
should it be 400 ?
his troubles are not over .
I know what they &apos;re paying you .
it went off smoothly .
why on earth do you want to know that ?
I don &apos;t know who did that .
what time is it over there ?
it &apos;s really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things , but you can think of it this way .
I had only one drink .
happy is the man who is contented .
but what &apos;s more difficult to navigate is the emotional landscape between the generations , and the old adage that with age comes wisdom is not true .
I still live at my dad &apos;s place .
they are actors .
the boughs of the large tree overhung the pond .
this apple is sour .
we &apos;re in trouble .
I found a rare stamp at that store .
you don &apos;t need to worry about wiretapping .
I just need to know what happened .
no meal is complete without bread .
he was caught with his pants down .
I just don &apos;t want to believe it .
that &apos;s not true at all .
we want to go to France .
has Tom been fired ?
these DNA machines are wonderful .
I won &apos;t go into great detail as to why , because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do , but suffice to say , a number of that form is fairly easy to test for primacy .
don &apos;t tell him I told you .
I &apos;ve spent a lot .
it seems that Cathy likes music .
they went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City and they barcoded it .
that &apos;s the reason that they &apos;re not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that &apos;s going on right now .
I probably should have said something .
he doesn &apos;t get jokes .
and I met a music video director named Chris Milk .
Tom is due to come at noon .
he drove the truck to Dallas .
but designers are really the glue that brings these things together .
he would promote the policeman immediately , so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily .
this should solve all your problems .
I have often admired the mystical way of Pythagoras , and the secret Magic of numbers .
the majority ignores that which has no name , and the majority believes in the existence of all that has a name .
archaea means &quot; &quot; the ancient ones . &quot; &quot;
this is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler .
the news soon spread all over the village .
and I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet Planet Ocean .
that &apos;s not really a solution .
the method we illustrate in this video uses a pre @-@ made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks .
I love what you &apos;ve done to this place .
the teams do a great job , and that &apos;s their work .
we were geologically illiterate , unaware of the antiquity of our own planet and ignorant of our connection to deep time .

Tom is a dive master .
my father and I will fish once in a while .
she &apos;s a patient woman .
seen from a distance , the hill looks like an elephant .
he hurried so he wouldn &apos;t miss the train .
and so there &apos;s a barcode on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
they &apos;ll have three stores left , but they try to spruce it up to make it appear like things are on the up @-@ and @-@ up .
I am just warming up now .
for this particular problem , we designed a new category of worker who , like a SARS worker or someone looking for bird flu , might find first cases .
a thousand years ago , you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building .
it &apos;s easy to fool the brain in 2D .
you must prepare yourself for the worst .
the separatists began to occupy the airport .
it doesn &apos;t work out too well , and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again , as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute , morbid astonishment .
so , it goes from a circle , to a round , to a square , to a figure eight .
that &apos;s absolute nonsense !
same thing with Receptin if you &apos;ve got breast cancer .
we &apos;ll meet at my house .
( Applause )
it &apos;s fairly warm today .
we have to find the right step to block , and then create a drug that does it .
because functionality defines environmental impact , and I said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco @-@ materials .
this proprietary principle of vendor lock @-@ in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere .
look .
the most exciting thing , I would say , about this census is the role of global science .
so on the one hand , there was a mocking of authority , but on the other hand , there was a deference towards authority , and these Caribbean people had an overbearing obedience towards authority , which is very striking , very strange in a way , because migrants are very courageous people .
he wrote an article for the Huffington Post headlined , &quot; Court Documents Prove I was Sent to a CMU for my Political Speech . &quot;
you won &apos;t escape me .
( Laughter ) I mean , look at those graphics there .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old designing a DNA experiment to protect the lives of astronauts may seem like a rarity , the mark of a child genius .
we have come a long way .
just exactly what do you want me to do ?
clearly , this is the most important point .
in some years , like this year , we found more than 80 percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil .
turn on the TV .
we can get showers up to 86 percent working , we can get electrical systems up to 77 percent working and we can get 90 percent of toilets working in those 7,500 houses .
that &apos;s one of the deadliest diseases known to humans .
the work is practically finished .
I &apos;d like to see that ring , please .
I couldn &apos;t have done that by myself .
I don &apos;t know why I even bother anymore .
is there a student discount ?
look how fat he is .
Mary opened her purse and looked around in it .
I was doing my breakfast radio show .
Tom is a little disoriented .
the next station is where you get off .
so they have invested all their money into there , and the blue bar , class size , is driving costs up .
she lost sight of her friend in the huge crowd .
I don &apos;t go out much .
they want me to organize the party .
the whole village knows the man well .
even judges use the output of these machines in court to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty based on DNA evidence .
Beware of jellyfish .
on my way home from school yesterday , I was caught in a shower .
and I know you think that because it &apos;s based on a building that was build 2,500 years ago by the Greeks .
so I started to travel around the mid @-@ Atlantic region filming these dead malls .
these are the dispensers .
you aren &apos;t the easiest person to live with .
your question has no answer .
Tom let us go .
I often go downtown on Sunday .
I like to swim in the afternoon .
he &apos;s an exorcist .
do you believe in a god ?
please make way for him .
I &apos;m a good taxi driver .
for some random reason , I can &apos;t imagine , something about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox .
why didn &apos;t you come to the party ?
do not feed the ducks .
so what &apos;s left ?
I &apos;ve got no plans . &quot; &quot;
I want to visit Australia one day .
what do you want to do after lunch ?
how enduring , our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished .
Tom won &apos;t come home .
our father and many of his colleagues exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving .
let me buy you a drink .
Tom never learned how to read and write .
why would you do that ?
( Laughter ) They use this scope to remove seeds using a little tweezer .
PR : that &apos;s absolutely true , and there &apos;s no such thing as pure food .
they &apos;re part of us .
I am going to the swimming pool .
I succeeded in getting what I wanted .
you can actually see the point when I know what I &apos;m doing , and a lot of light and dark comes into it .
he has a very important job of monitoring all of the electricity coming into the system to make sure there is enough so it powers everybody &apos;s homes .
for example , you &apos;ll have an empty store and they bring the gate down .
( Laughter ) The malls that are still open , they always do this weird thing - like the dead malls .
you &apos;re fluent in French , right ?
congratulations !
you look happy .
Tom has a son .
you &apos;ve never seen a genuine diamond .
what do you learn English for ?
it is out of the question .
wash your feet .
but if I have to prove who I am , I &apos;ll never send that message .
Sami hasn &apos;t even finished reading one page .
nothing has gone right all day .
they are commissioned .
at first , French was a dialect .

that &apos;s what I hope .
I did it in a hurry .
some say that Israel should be boycotted for its apartheid system .
do you really want to win ?

atomic energy can be used for peaceful ends .
I &apos;m sure Tom will leave early .
Mary is a yodeler .
they &apos;re called The Oblique Strategies , he developed them with a friend of his .
he walked through the forest .
they deceived us .
today , there are 40 million patients like Auguste , who can &apos;t create the change they need for themselves .
and environmental folklore is a really important thing because we &apos;re trying to do the right thing .
it can improve health and it can play a part in reducing , if not eliminating , poverty .
in fact , what Skinner discovered is that , if you put a pigeon in a box like this , and he has to press one of these two keys , and he tries to figure out what the pattern is , and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there - if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern , they will figure out any kind of pattern .
you are singing now .
when were you thinking of coming back to the States ?
all right , all right .
a man of sense would be ashamed to do so .
man proposes , God disposes .

no doubt , those worlds would be both amazing and amazingly improbable , but they would not be our world and they would not have our history .

do what you want , I don &apos;t really care .
Tom was badly beaten up .

Tom is still inside .
this is all seven Harry Potter novels , because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end .
when we look at pictures like this , they take our breath away , in addition to helping to give us breath by the oxygen that the oceans provide .

I just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
in all likelihood , we shall be away for a few days .
I think we were lucky .
on the one side is innovation , and architects are constantly pushing , pushing for new technologies , new typologies , new solutions for the way that we live today .
it &apos;s either the little voice at the back of your head , or it &apos;s that gut feeling you get when you &apos;ve done the right thing , so when you &apos;ve picked the paper bag or when you &apos;ve bought a fuel @-@ efficient car .
you are talking .
now which one of these looks odd to you ?
my father bought me a digital watch for birthday present .
the teacher punished her students for using bad words .
time is more precious than anything else .
is there anything that I can do for you ?
I don &apos;t know what to make of this .
if only I could already speak German fluently !
does he know that you love him ?
is anybody in there ?
they chose him as their representative .
I like these chairs .
almost all of the transactions you do are not , who are you ?
it might have been a politician .
call me if you need assistance .
right now , I want to speak Lojban .
I think we &apos;re ready to go .
I can hear you loud and clear .
Compassion is the basis of all morality .
I think what you say is true .
they hung their coats behind the door .
at home everything is early , both talent and baldness .
the developing world bug , trachoma , causes blindness .
with my short time today , I want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition .
so I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity , but we actually haven &apos;t really changed the design of them that much since the 1950s .
it &apos;s a conspiracy .
now , some people have criticized us for this .
she gets six feet away , turns around , smiles and goes , &quot; &quot; You should probably know this , too : I &apos;m still dating that guy , four years later . &quot; &quot;
there are only 10 minutes left until the end of the lesson .
don &apos;t be afraid .
I bought a game for the kids .
I have visited Paris once .
he dotes on his grandson .
the baby is sleeping .
I &apos;ve just eaten some sushi and drunk a beer .
stop being so fucking retarded !
RM : I think it &apos;s OK , but - ( Laughter ) here come the big no @-@ nos of flag design .
and then somebody else said , well , what if the star had already formed planets , and two of these planets had collided , similar to the Earth @-@ Moon forming event .
we have to get you to a hospital .
we need to make sacrifices .
I sliced the sandwich diagonally .
while I was swimming , I got a cramp in my leg .
there are many steps , and identifying which step to try to block is complex - like defusing a bomb .
get your coat .
there &apos;s many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a dog .
I never had a girlfriend before .
why don &apos;t you start by telling us who went with you ?
we &apos;ve had to plant seeds , phosphorus , fertilizers , nutrients , water , sunlight .
it walks over the pad , and you know who it is .
Tom wants Mary to meet his mother .
so it has to be something that anybody could build on .
he was beaten too easily .
most natural things don &apos;t actually end up in nature .
so now you understand how viruses can attack cells .
I thought I was going to die .
she is frightened of thunder .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his dog .
they just don &apos;t present that often .
she crossed her legs .
( Laughter ) And it was a prototype .
I &apos;m afraid that Tom is involved in a crime .
you may recognize these two guys .
thank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .
Tom has sold his house in Boston .
I just have to do something .
I appreciate what you did yesterday .
it &apos;s a good thing to read good books when you are young .
practicing prior to game time .
do you know who lives in that house ?
there were no bounds to his ambition .
how long will this go on ?
I bought her a new car .
he wrote a lot of books on China .
both men were rescued .
so imagine , you &apos;re in the supermarket , you &apos;re buying some groceries , and you get given the option for a plastic or a paper shopping bag .
and as we walked , I was struck that I had reverted to being the child even though I was now towering above my father .
at the risk of surprising you , I happen to work .
TV plays an important part in everyday life .
I &apos;ll keep this cake for myself .
stop playing hard to get .
I bet you &apos;re talking about Tom .
the last thing I want to do is cause you any more pain .
design @-@ wise , it manages to both be too crude and have too many details at the same time , which if you were trying for that , you wouldn &apos;t be able to do it , and it just looks bad at a distance , but having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column .
planets don &apos;t get much bigger than Jupiter .
he is a man who is fond of ceremony .
and of course , the ambiguous figures that seem to flip @-@ flop back and forth .
how could you not say something ?
my skill is not in the mathematics .
now , I looked at a number of kettles available on the market , and found the minimum fill lines , so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there , was between two and a five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half cups of water just to make one cup of tea .
stories often have happy endings .
it led to lawsuits - ( Laughter ) - federal investigations , and lots of repercussions , and that &apos;s a scandal we won &apos;t discuss today .
the boys were as nervous as the girls .
each year , 40 percent of the potential harvest is lost to pest and disease .
because it worked .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
no one was allowed up on the top .
but that meant that two years before the building was complete , it was already a part of the community , so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product , there were no surprises .
he &apos;s beating me , three to zip .
she promised to meet him at the coffee shop .
he continued to mock me .
I wasn &apos;t actually at the G20 protest , but I had a meeting at a bank on the day of the G20 protest , and I got an email from the bank saying please don &apos;t wear a suit , because it &apos;ll inflame the protesters .
it &apos;s a matter of either @-@ or .
why would I be nervous ?
I hate fluorescent lights .
and you can also see the way that it was drawn .
your driver &apos;s license has expired .
we &apos;re in charge .
running as fast as I could , I was able to catch up with my friend .
what has he done ?
( Laughter )
I told you not to talk about the matter in her presence .
the employee was escorted off the premises .
he controls dust on mining company sites .
I &apos;m not kidding .
and so we went ahead and published our findings .
do other planets exist , on which life can exist ?
I don &apos;t have any choice .
push the job and get it done this week .
and that &apos;s a unique opportunity , I would say , in design .
( Laughter ) So the original episodes I filmed with an iPhone .
remember that .
a boy ran up to me .
I hate these shoes .
and there &apos;s whole industries designed for managing bad people .
is this a letter ?
it is illegal to park a car there .
you worry about your weight too much .
everyone was horrified .
it would be a good idea to try doing that .
I was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , I guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
you guys remember that ?
in some of these cases , they have great representation that I mentioned , but there &apos;s just not a public awareness of what &apos;s happening .
I never meant to hurt any of you .
that &apos;s about 2,700 fresh , connective links across about 112 million blogs that are out there .
does she always smoke Charles &apos; cigarettes ?
it was kind of always hard to get into the ones that were abandoned , but I somehow always found a way in .
now , it &apos;s fairly easy to find rocks of the right age at this point , because the Earth is , to a coarse degree , geologically mapped .
take away love , and our earth is a tomb !
I &apos;m here with a friend .
the oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet .
as is often the case with her , she didn &apos;t show up on time .
my father gave it to me when I was a kid .
I think you need someone to talk to .
you lied to me , didn &apos;t you ?
or you can do it through loss of consciousness , by accelerating in a centrifuge .
but the third pillar that he talked about was design .
I hate to wait .
he failed to come yesterday .
everything &apos;s going to work out .
how lonely and helpless she must feel left all by herself !
when he asked who had broken the window , all the boys put on an air of innocence .
and so began industrial fishing .
there &apos;s my visitor &apos;s badge .
we &apos;ll have plenty of time for that later .
ready , rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors ! it &apos;s a draw !
I &apos;m accustomed to working hard .
don &apos;t touch my car .
I thought about writing you a message , but never got around to it .
just smart people moving bits .
you will always be welcome .
where did he get that crazy idea from ?
I &apos;m on your side .
what kind of music does Tom like ?
on his shirt there was a sauce stain .
I have a large bedroom .
be kind to little animals .
in those days , one hid much else as well : grown men didn &apos;t embrace one another , unless someone had died , and not always then ; you shook hands or , at a ball game , thumped your friend &apos;s back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection ; once out of childhood you &apos;d never again know the shock of your father &apos;s whiskers on your cheek , not until mores at last had evolved , and you could hug another man , then hold on for a moment , then even kiss ( your fathers bristles white and stiff now ) .
it said , &quot; &quot; Money does does make me happy . &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s the &apos; 80s , it &apos;s cool .
here &apos;s the cartoon on the left there .
it &apos;s not .
why do you always want to do things the hard way ?
this is something we &apos;ve actually known for a while , so it &apos;s not a real breakthrough .
please permit me to ask you some questions .
it is in our DNA to be curious .
and there are no good training methods to get really good at getting this scope to the right place .
I wonder if anything happened to him .
we asked a question about how the mind works , and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant .
because they &apos;re watching television .
I want you to have a job that you love .
she was appreciably tanned after her vacation .
what &apos;s wrong with those ?
I &apos;m sure Tom was involved .
so we called it Y Water .
we decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for , which is making money .
the weather today is worse than yesterday .
some of us might be willing to go .
when my documentary was aired on SBS Dateline , many of my friends came to know about my situation , and they tried to help me .
and this doesn &apos;t include fusions or name changes or changes in flags .
he decided to have the operation .
Tom has been blind since birth .
it took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl .
we found life in the extremes .
I know you &apos;ve been trying to help .
yes , my child .
I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll pass the coming exam .
no , more than impulse or fancy , the girl knows what she &apos;s doing , the girl means something , the girl means to mean , because it occurs to her in that instant , that beautiful or not , bright yes or no , she &apos;s not who she is , she &apos;s not the person she is , and the reason , she suddenly knows , is that there &apos;s been so much premeditation where she is , so much plotting and planning , there &apos;s hardly a person where she is , or if there is , it &apos;s not her , or not wholly her , it &apos;s a self inhabited , lived in by her , and seemingly even as she thinks it
I didn &apos;t even know Tom had a girlfriend .
I thought about it for a nanosecond .
my older brother is an authority on philosophy .
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore .
I want to spend my life with you .
I told the news to everyone I met .
and like I said before , most country flags are OK .
you &apos;re lucky to have such a good job .
Tom easily guessed Mary &apos;s password .
we can believe everything .
I think I might have a drinking problem .
this contributor has asked for advanced contributor status . please feel free to share your opinion with us . send us a message using the following link .
are you falling in love with me ?
( girl : no . )
the Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner , and displayed the appetite of a tramp .
last week five students were absent from class .
all because of a word I said , not even said really , only repeated .
I already told you he isn &apos;t here .
can you help me plant this shrub ?
you must not stop on the hard shoulder to go to the toilet .
it &apos;s a sacred right .
the way this showed up in the textbook , it looked like this : &quot; &quot; Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium . &quot; &quot;
all you have to do is talk .
we love our mother almost without knowing it , without feeling it , as it is as natural as to live .
we opened this store in 2013 .
we have less than we had before , and most of them are in fairly steep decline .
at two o &apos;clock in the morning , we assembled the team , and took the reproduced anatomy that we would gain out of scans and images , and brought that team to the virtual bedside , to a simulated bedside - the same team that &apos;s going to operate on this child in the hours ahead - and we have them do the procedure .
I know Tom is a good actor .
so I &apos;m going to show you a few of the projects that I &apos;ve been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems .
those are the critical questions , and what we have learned from PISA is that , in high @-@ performing education systems , the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education , their future , more than consumption today .
Tom apologized .
he has no spatial awareness .
but this is just a greenhouse experiment .
I want to see it .
stop filming .
Tom is in the morgue .
her skin was almost translucent .
Heck , it was everything .
and at times , when we were like this , so much &quot; &quot; Shhh , &quot; &quot; so much &quot; &quot; Shhh &quot; &quot; going on in the house that I imagined us to be like the German crew of a U @-@ boat creeping along the edge of the ocean whilst up above , on the surface , HMS Bageye patrolled ready to drop death charges at the first sound of any disturbance .
Hey , how &apos;s it going down there ?
and so the first projects were sort of humble , but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way , and maybe finding some new functionality .
PH : Oh , but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch .
you were listening .
I &apos;m trying to figure out what you do for fun .
I wish you were here with me now .
I know now her life was hard ; she lost three children as babies , then her husband died too , leaving young sons , and no money .
( Applause )
her shadow once , fumbling the chain on her door , then the door slamming fearfully shut , only the barking and the music - jazz - filtering as it does , day and night into the hall .
I didn &apos;t want to do this in the first place .
you aren &apos;t looking .
Dennis &apos; pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry .
I had no idea Tom would do that .
see , why not ?
Ordinarily , the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction .
if you rest , you will be back on your feet again soon .
I suggest we go out for a drink .
he is a true colossus .
you should stop .
we &apos;re generating about 3.12 states per year .
I &apos;m going to take two aspirins before going to bed because I have a sore throat .
he almost convinced me .
above all things , we must not be selfish .
how many classes do you have on Mondays ?
we miss Tom terribly .
could you please take care of my dog while I &apos;m in Boston ?
( Laughter )
but sometimes things go wrong , and some sticky bits are on the outside .
she is my mother @-@ in @-@ law .
the town was full of activity .
don &apos;t dwell too much upon the subject .
I hope you have insurance .
Tom thinks Mary is ugly .
but we don &apos;t stop here .
but what is really amazing , because of this deepness here , Emperor penguins can go down more than 500 meters and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes .
the only thing that matters is that you weren &apos;t injured .
and I collected a lot , a lot of different sheep .
and the most impressive outcomes of world @-@ class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system .
I had a promise to keep .
( Laughter ) So when we &apos;re talking about authenticity , it &apos;s a little more fractal than it appears and that &apos;s a good example to show it .
did he do this to you ?
the batter steps out of the box and takes a practice swing .
with PISA , we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity , in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances .
this is where our sampling effort has concentrated .
you know , the computer and television both recently turned 60 , and today I &apos;d like to talk about their relationship .
the house closest to here is two miles away .
do we need an universal language ?
in hindsight , this was a mistake .
are you sure we have enough beer ?
Tom has decided to have the surgery that his doctor recommended .
I never drink beer before lunch .
don &apos;t smile .
I was born on October 10th , 1972 .
you can see the large seeds .
my favorite one was he was in the manhole .
it &apos;s sometimes necessary not to tell the truth .
Tom is a bad coach .
today , nine years after they were opened by the Bush administration , the government is codifying how and why CMUs were created .
and whereas television may have gotten beat up , what &apos;s getting built is a really exciting new form of communication , and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it .
Tom fell in love with the characters in his novel .
you can &apos;t win them all .
it &apos;s just a drop in the ocean .
while you slept , I watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky .
hot dogs , nuts and seeds , chunks of meat or cheese , whole grapes , hard / gooey or sticky candy , popcorn , chunks of peanut butter , raw vegetables , raisins , chewing gum , and marshmallows are known choking hazards for children .
Automobiles replaced carriages .
no one knows where he lives .
both alternatives are possible .
and now he &apos;s looking at the other guy , saying , &quot; &quot; You are really weird . &quot; &quot;
it depends on how much money you have .
you look like a lawyer .
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left .
the Rhine runs between France and Germany .
it makes no fucking sense .
does he speak ? he sings , rather ! since I seasoned it , we can no longer stop it .
TR : you &apos;re doing courageous work .
Repetition helps you remember something .
it happens more often than you would think .
I want you home by midnight .
there appears to be a party in that house .
and something a little bit more experimental : this is a light fixture for Swarovski , and what it does is , it changes shape .
the New York Times called this building a miracle .
a strong cup of coffee helps me wake up .
they want someone to help them .
I was ushered to my seat .
how is your daughter ?
and they would give the projects code names , you know , mostly from &quot; &quot; Star Wars , &quot; &quot; actually : things like C3PO , Yoda , Luke .
kids do stupid things .
the pain has lessened a little .
he will soon get used to the climate here .
I have some inside information about the company &apos;s plans to go public .
I &apos;m bored . let &apos;s do something fun .
conservation group gets together , tries to figure out how to breed an animal that &apos;s almost extinct .
I beg your pardon .
Mary sings best of all of the girls in class .
in less developed countries , it &apos;s estimated that 300,000 people die every year because of insecticide misuse and exposure .
two generations ago , Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today , and was one of the lowest education performers .
so , the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells is really a history of where you &apos;ve been for the past billion years .
even though it &apos;s three meters long , it actually , again , eluded science .
how are you feeling today ?
he is miles away .
the bill , please .
all are interested in Japan .
I am someone .
Earning our customers confidence and respect is this firm &apos;s objective .
so a new technology in health care : lifelike rehearsal .
the fly running on the mirror doesn &apos;t worry about its reflection on the points of its legs from which it sits and runs ; but on the contrary , it sees on the smooth surface a quantity of very small things which interest it and which we confuse with dust and grime .
Tom used to bake us cookies .
and so it was on , the classic human versus machine gamble .
you need to filter the output of this command in order to display only the lines with &quot; foo &quot; inside .
and so she went to one of the girls , and said , &quot; you have to give me your Facebook password . &quot;
it &apos;s against the law .
the man reading a newspaper is his father .
you ain &apos;t seen nothing yet .
and these plants need sunlight , so we know when we find that sediment there &apos;s no ice overhead .
this is a nice building .
Tom tried to cheer Mary up .
I would like a piece of cheese .
malaria had been stuck .
we let that lie around in the sun .
that article makes fun of vegetarians .
why do you work here ?
doesn &apos;t anyone want to speak to me ?
that guy &apos;s a friend of mine .
and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals - what were we aiming at ?
the technology already exists .
in fact , the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe .
I am wondering if I could be of any service to you .
I have to put my shoes on .
STM 3 : all right , this is behaving like a vessel .
I &apos;m sure that you &apos;ll succeed .
Justice in this country is a bit of a double standard : there is the justice of the poor and the justice of the rich .
seven to one is the ratio , they tend to say .
I just received your letter .
he married my cousin .
she wore a red blouse .
I can &apos;t tell you how angry that makes me .
is this fake ?
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s husband .
that &apos;s the way it is .
now , the last of these things died in September 1936 .
the living room in my new house is very large .
they caught Tom .
I love this photo .
and I realized then I had to go to design school .
Tom doesn &apos;t agree with you .
there were no customers , so we closed the shop early .
their visits can be limited to four hours per month , compared to the 35 hours that people like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph receive in the supermax .
that &apos;s impossible .
you &apos;ll find this lesson easy .
the milk is sour .
girl 2 : I think we - the reasons , one of the reasons we put computer before TV is because nowadays , like , we have TV shows on the computer .
science will not solve all of our problems .
you &apos;ve got to be bold !
the dinosaurs would reign for another 12 million years before their hegemony was snuffed out in a fiery apocalypse .
Tom pushed Mary into doing that .
just pretend I &apos;m not here .
beat the egg whites until stiff .
the train should reach Osaka by ten .
it &apos;s a shame .
I am still young .
we need a strategy .
Tom was like a brother to me .
if you &apos;d listen , you &apos;d understand .
it was an exercise in democratic schooling , and I am all for democratic schooling , but we were only seven .
and then the integration of all these great technologies , which you &apos;ve heard about , the Wi @-@ Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect ; the screen , which you can read in sunlight ; the keyboard , which is made out of rubber , and it &apos;s protected from the environment .
stop yelling .
my father and my mother left Jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles , and yet they were infantilized by travel .
they &apos;re trying to preserve the status quo , not to improve .
he lived alone in the countryside .
I like bananas more than apples .
he instantly fell in love with her .
but through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home with my dog curled up at my feet , a cup of tea in my hand , and I could tell the pilot , &quot; &quot; I want a sample right there . &quot; &quot;
I had even learned through the Bureau of Prisons Counterterrorism Unit , that they had been monitoring my speeches about CMUs , like this one .
the ceremony was impressive .
I just can &apos;t believe this .
I never should have returned here .
everything is different now .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
but this is a global phenomenon , we know that .
this example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed .
that cat is brown .
they took up the challenge , and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading .
so what &apos;s actually happened is , although there is still some opposition , the movement is clearly growing .
dude , seriously .
we had to lessen the impact of the erratic supplies .
if we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier , we could start by saying something like , &quot; &quot; These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium . &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m starting to get used to the food here .
theory and practice do not necessarily go together .
I &apos;ve stopped paying attention to arrogant , materialistic and unpleasant people .
Pollutants like this derive mainly from the combustion of fuel in car engines .
there is a cafeteria in the university .
( music ) PH : by this time , computing had kind of leapt into media territory , and in short order much of what we &apos;re doing today was imagined in Cambridge and Silicon Valley .
and if you find one that you &apos;re interested in , you can actually click on it and open up an information panel where you &apos;re able to rate that frame , which helps it bubble up to the top .
the first thing that we ever read was in 1995 : a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae .
she always arrives on time .
there are two ways : on the left is what we call the lytic way , where the viruses go right in and take over the cells .
here &apos;s a towel you can use .
that &apos;s when I leave graduate school , and I can &apos;t work in New York on kind of entertainment and technology because I have to be exiled to California , where the remaining jobs are , almost to the sea , to go to work for Apple Computer .
I don &apos;t like cold coffee .
what are some foods you usually eat with your children ?
&quot; &quot; Websites attract striking writers : operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com could benefit from labor disputes . &quot; &quot;
this is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
I have been in Kobe since 1980 .
they are islands unto themselves .
you won &apos;t believe this .
this is a pretty involved process ; it took us about four and a half years .
we &apos;ll deal with it in the morning .
all you do is complain .
what &apos;re you doing ?
they wake up at six every morning .
Oh , sorry .
I &apos;ve decided to do the same thing .
today we &apos;re going to hunt for that massive prime .
when you go to a place that &apos;s relatively unexplored , you have a much better chance of not only finding fossils but of finding something that &apos;s new to science .
I stayed there until he had left .
where do we find the most species of ocean life ?
would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge ?
stock prices fell sharply .
come on , give me a kiss .
he killed 63 percent of the Hazara population .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
Tom wants to stay single .
would you mind speaking more slowly ?
researchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day will save the lives of thousands of children .
could I help you ?
we really can make this happen .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
so we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track CO2 levels in the atmosphere , going back millions of years .
and it will be really boring .
what does a Scotsman wear under his kilt ?
any chance of us getting approved ?
( Laughter ) I kid you not .
cows are sacred to many people in India .
the report was put together from data collected by the Center for Disease Control .
one way you can spend money is by paying teachers well , and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession .
we cleaned up our room .
big operation .
my grandmother lives in the country .
I ate too much last night .
there &apos;s no exit .
do you watch television ?
why is he learning Spanish ?
we want a rematch .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough friends .
this past year , in 2009 , you can see that they &apos;re now raising about a fourth of a chick , and some of these individuals are going more than 900 kilometers away from their nests .
so the theory , in a way , is kind of being validated by the treatment .
where can I rent a costume ?
we haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
you should get rid of that bad habit .
and you had a big sign promoting Shinerama , &quot; &quot; - which is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis , a charity I &apos;ve worked with for years - &quot; &quot; And you had a bucketful of lollipops .
I &apos;ll do all the talking .
it was an eye @-@ opening experience .
Tom is an architect , right ?
see , our pattern detection device , which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex - it &apos;s our little detection device there - can be easily fooled , and this is the problem .
I knew it would happen sooner or later .
I think Tom is still sleeping .
this is looking at another event .
to know is to know that you know nothing . that is the meaning of true knowledge .
the volcano erupts .
